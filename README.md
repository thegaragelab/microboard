# Microboard MCU Prototyping System

The Microboard form factor is a simple breakout board for various MCUs that
integrates with the [Clixx.IO](http://clixx.io) rapid prototyping system through
a set of external docks. It's goal is to allow the rapid development of
microcontroller based projects using Clixx.

Board designs can be found in the 'boards' directory. All schematics are in
[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) format. There is a template project
available in 'boards/template' that can be used to design a board for your
own MCU.
