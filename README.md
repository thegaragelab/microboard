# Microboard MCU Prototyping System

The Microboard form factor is a simple breakout board for various MCUs that
integrates with the [Clixx.IO](http://clixx.io) rapid prototyping system through
a set of external docks. It's goal is to allow the rapid development of
microcontroller based projects using Clixx.
