# Microboard for ATmega8/88/168 CPUs

This is the original Microboard that evolved from the [Babyduino](https://github.com/thegaragelab/babyduino)
project. It contains a simple Arduino compatible board and bootloaders with
full integration into the Arduino IDE. The connector pins are designed to
integrate with [Clixx.IO](http://clixx.io) docks.
